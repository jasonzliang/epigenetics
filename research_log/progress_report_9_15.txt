Jason is currently investigating a computational model of epigenetics that can be used to improve performance of neuroevolutionary algorithms on reinforcement learning type problems.  Specifically, the experimental domain is the maze navigation problem, where a neural network controlled robot fitted with range-finders must travel from the starting point of the maze to the end point within a fixed amount of time. He is currently working on using methylation values to perform neuromodulation on the hidden nodes in the neural network. The methylation values increase for nodes that are most active when the maze navigation task is successful and decrease for the active nodes when the maze navigation task is not successful. In contrast to genes, which are subject to mutation and crossover, these methylation values are passed down through the generations directly. He is also examining how Lamarckian learning can be used to transfer knowledge (gained through Hebbian learning during task evaluation) across different generations. The ultimate goal is to come up with a method for transferring knowledge learned from successful maze runs through a mechanism other than just evolution.
